## 📖 **Project Overview**  
AI Case Law RAG is an **AI-driven legal research assistant** that enables users to efficiently search, retrieve, and analyze case laws and bare laws using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).**  

This system combines **ChromaDB** for vector-based search and **Llama 3-8B (via Ollama)** for AI-generated responses, allowing **fast, context-aware, and intelligent retrieval of legal documents**. The project is designed to improve legal research by reducing search time, improving accuracy, and automating the process of case law retrieval.

## ❓ **Why Do We Need This Project?**  
### 🔎 **Challenges in Legal Research Today**  
1. **Huge Volume of Data:** Legal databases contain **millions of case laws**, making manual research inefficient.  
2. **Time-Consuming Searches:** Lawyers and researchers spend hours trying to find relevant cases.  
3. **Lack of Contextual Understanding:** Traditional legal search engines rely on **keyword matching** rather than understanding the intent behind a query.  
4. **Keeping Up with Updates:** New legal precedents are published frequently, making it hard to stay updated.  

### 🏆 **How This Project Solves These Issues**  
✅ **AI-powered natural language search** retrieves case laws based on meaning rather than keywords.  
✅ **Vector-based semantic search with ChromaDB** ensures **precise** and **contextually relevant** results.  
✅ **Dynamic ingestion of legal documents** ensures that the database remains updated with the latest laws.  
✅ **Summarized insights** help legal professionals quickly understand case relevance.
